Active Directory is a directory service that runs on Microsoft Windows Server. It is used for [identity and access management](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/security/business/security-101/what-is-identity-access-management-iam#:~:text=Identity%20and%20access%20management%20software,access%2C%20and%20flagging%20security%20breaches.). AD DS stores and organizes information about the people, devices and services connected to a network. AD DS serves as a locator service for those objects and as a way for organizations to have a central point of administration for all activity on the corporate network.

AD DS is used in on-premises Windows environments, and Microsoft Azure AD DS is used in cloud-based Windows environments. They can be used together in hybrid cloud environments.

The AD DS database is the central store of all the domain objects, such as user accounts, computer accounts, and groups. AD DS provides a searchable, hierarchical directory and a method for applying configuration and security settings for objects in an enterprise.

AD DS includes both **Logical** and **Physical** components defined bellow.
## Logical Components

1. **Partition :** A partition, or naming context, is a portion of the AD DS database. Although the database consists of one file named **Ntds.dit** , different partitions contain different data. 
	For example, the schema partition contains a copy of the Active Directory schema. The configuration partition contains the configuration objects for the forest, and the domain partition contains the users, computers, groups, and other objects specific to the domain. Active Directory stores copies of partitions on multiple domain controllers and updates them through directory replication.
	
2. **Schema :** A schema is the set of definitions of the object types and attributes that you use to define the objects created in AD DS.

3. **Domain :** A domain is a logical administrative container for objects such as **users** and **computers**. A domain maps to a specific partition and you can organize the domain with parent-child relationships to other domains.

4. **Domain Tree :** A domain tree is a hierarchical collection of domains that share a common root domain and a contiguous Domain Name System (DNS) namespace.

5. **Forest :** A forest is a collection of one or more domains that have a common AD DS root, a common schema, and a common global catalog.

6. **Organizational Unit :** An OU is a container object for users, groups, and computers that provides a framework for delegating administrative rights and administration by linking Group Policy Objects (GPO)s.

7. **Container :** A container is an object that provides an organizational framework for use in AD DS. You can use the default containers, or you can create custom containers. You can't link GPOs to containers.
	For Example **Organisational Units** or **OUs** are also a type of container in Microsoft Domain Services.It can contain objects like **users, computers, contacts, groups, or other OU's or containers**. OU's can also have **group policies** applied.

## Physical Components

1. **Domain controller :** A domain controller contains a copy of the AD DS database. For most operations, each domain controller can process changes and replicate the changes to all the other domain controllers in the domain.

2. **Data store :** A copy of the data store exists on each domain controller. The AD DS database uses Microsoft Jet database technology and stores the directory information in the **Ntds.dit** file and associated log files. The **C:\\Windows\\NTDS** folder stores these files by default.

3. **Global Catalog Server :** A global catalog server is a domain controller that hosts the global catalog, which is a **partial, read-only copy of all the objects in a multiple-domain forest**. A global catalog speeds up searches for objects that might be stored on domain controllers in a different domain in the forest.

4. **Read-only domain controller (RODC) :** An RODC is a special, read only installation of AD DS. RODCs are common in branch offices where physical security is not optimal, IT support is less advanced than in the main corporate centers, or line-of-business applications need to run on a domain controller.

5. **Site :** A site is a container for AD DS objects, such as computers and services that are specific to a physical location. This is in comparison to a domain, which represents the logical structure of objects, such as users and groups, in addition to computers.

6. **Subnet :** A subnet is a portion of the network IP addresses of an organization assigned to computers in a site. Subnets are **a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments**. A site can have more than one subnet.
