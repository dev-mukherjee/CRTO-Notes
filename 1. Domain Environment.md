# What is A Domain ?

There are **two** types of logical network designs exists ->
- **WORKGROUP
- **DOMAIN**

**Workgroup** is similar to Home Network Group. Information gets saved into the **SAM** **Database** of the machines.Only the network switch they are connected with is the common between devices in workgroups. Nothing is accessible over the Network other than **ICMP**.

Managing this is a great chaos for working environments where there may be **1000+ users or computers** so they prefer **DOMAIN** Environments, where there is **one** or **many** **Domain** Controller(s) or **DC(s)** have a feature installed called [[2. Active Directory]]. The feature is called **Active Directory Domain Services  or  AD-DS.

It is a **FEATURE** for creation & management of **Users,Groups,Computers,Group Policies**. After adding a computer to a Domain Environment it utilizes the **Domain Controller** rather then its **SAM Database**.If I need to **disable a User**, **change its Password**,**restrict its access** I can do that by using **Active Directory Services**. Everything is managed from the Domain controller.

# Domain Trusts

Trust relationships are an **administration** and **communication** link between two domains. A trust relationship between two domains enables **user accounts** and **global groups** to be used in a domain other than the domain where the **accounts are defined**.

Account information is shared to validate the **rights** and **permissions** of **user accounts** and **global groups** residing in the trusted domain without being authenticated. *Trust relationships simplify user administration by combining two or more domains into an single administrative unit.*

There are two types of trusts ->
- **Transitive Trust** : Transitive trust is a two-way relationship automatically created between parent and child domains in Microsoft Active Directory Forest. When a domain is created, it shares the resource with its parent domain by default, enabling an authenticated users to access a resource in both the child and parent.

- **Non-Transitive Trust** : In Non-Transitive trust, if domain A trusts domain B, and domain B has a non-transitive trust with domain C. In this case, even though domain A has an indirect link to domain C through domain B, domain A does not trust domain C because the trust is non-transitive.
	- **One Way Trust** : It means that when a domain trusts another domain, that trust does not replicate visa versa. Hence, the trust flows only one way.
	- **Two Way Trust** : In two-way trust, when one domain trusts another domain, the other way is also trust. So, both domains can access the resource of the other.

There are **Five** types of Trust in **Active** **Directory** â€“

- **Parent-child Trust.**
- **Tree-Root Trust.**
- **Forest Trust.**
- **Shortcut Trust.**
- **Realm Trust.**
- **External Trust.**
# Domain Forest

- **DOMAIN TREE** : A **_domain tree_** is made up of several domains that share a common schema and configuration, forming a contiguous namespace. Domains in a tree are also linked together by trust relationships. Active Directory is a set of one or more trees.

- **DOMAIN FOREST** : A **_forest_** is a set of one or more domain trees that do not form a contiguous namespace. All trees in a forest share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. All trees in a given forest exchange trust according to transitive hierarchical Kerberos trust relationships.

- **PARENT DOMAIN** : A parent domain is a domain that holds a subdomain. For example: `weedislife.com`

- **CHILD DOMAIN** : And `marijuana.weedislife.com` is a child domain (or subdomain) of `weedislife.com`.
